## The Motivation

We set out with the sole intention of creating a really good object overlay toolkit. 

It would use object properties along with predefined conditions (forward-facing subjects, a reasonable amount of resolution, etc.) to accurately place objects in a scene. We say scene because the original goal of the project was to produce a system that could work on a per-frame basis. Being so, it would reproduce the effect seen in platforms like Snapchat or those employed in some animation.

So, to address our initially proposed idea - it can still be seen in our work. This project was always going to be inspired by things like Photo Booth, but an opportunity presented itself in the form of tracking.js

The [tracking.js](https://trackingjs.com/tracking.js) library offers face detection that, if licensed, could have worked with our algorithms to enable execution at a given frame - that is, if we were able to build our code using JavaScript. 

That’s a venture for another day.
